## Objectives

In this project, we are required to perform a qualitative research.

- **Draft 1**: By 09/22, we should finish the RQ (research question) proposal and the team contract (I personally prefer to call it an agreement). The submitting link is on [Canvas](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/193792/assignments/2435455).

	- The draft of the team agreement is [already finished](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/blob/master/Team%20Agreement.typ).
	It is written in *Typst*, because I want to try out this new light-weight typesetting language which aims to be a substitution for *LaTeX*.
	For compiled PDF, see [here](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/blob/master/Draft%201/Research%20Proposal.pdf).

	- The research proposal is also drafted for the [first version](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/blob/master/Research%20Proposal.typ) (compiled PDF is [here](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/blob/master/Draft%201/Research%20Proposal.pdf)).

- **Draft 2**: By 09/29, we should be completing the first half of the research thesis (see [description on Canvas](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/193792/assignments/2435456))—the Abstract, Related Work and Method sections.

	- By this time, the data collection should have already begun.

		- Alex could help design the interviewing process.

	- Alex has made a draft on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fw_HNCFMxxFowANbz8vmtRvFRqIORqCO4FE3gH9We5E/edit#heading=h.hy6jzg8b99d).
	I'm transcribing his work into [Typst](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/blob/master/Draft%202/Thesis%20Draft.typ) (compiled PDF is [here](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/blob/master/Draft%202/Thesis%20Draft.pdf)).
	Later I will adapt the content into a more academical writing style.

- **Presentation**: On 10/04, we need to do a presentation to the whole class about our research.

- **Final Report**: By 10/13, we should finish and submit the final report thesis.

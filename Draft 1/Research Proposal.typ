When discussing with the team about the RQ, a video I watched earlier came up in my mind.
The video is #link("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI2CLIDj4Kw")[on _YouTube_], with a title of "The 2 Week Minecraft Phase Explained".
It introduces a phenomenon that a lot of _Minecraft_ players often get tired of their newly-started savegames quickly after playing them for a period of 2 weeks or so.
However, unlike what it's stating in the title, the video does _not_ explain why players do that _at all_; all it does is just pointing the thing out and leaves a mystery in viewers' minds!
This has been bugging me for a month (I've even put this question on the brainstorm board on the first class), so I proposed this as the topic for us to do the research.
Surprisingly, the other two members approved this plan immediately; it turns out they are _Minecraft_ players as well.
So this is it, the RQ is set.
Next we need to do is to look for possible related research papers and hope that it hasn't been done yet!

= Methods & Data Samples

The question is asking about a subjective feeling of _Minecraft_ players, thus we must try to get direct information from real people. For qualitative researches, there are two major methods that fit our case: _taking surveys_ and _doing interviews_.

To us, with in a limited time range, taking surveys would be an easier options.
The target sample would be any reachable _Minecraft_ players, online or in-person.
Fortunately, we are in touch with #underline([the _Minecraft Wiki_ Discord server]), which is a place consisting of thousands of players all across the globe.
They make up an amazing sample base for our research.

We could also do in-person interviews, but then we will not be able to gather data from online sources.
Instead, we can narrow the sampling range to #underline([all students on the campus]);
there should be many students that play _Minecraft_!
---That means we will find a place in the campus area and randomly interview passing-by students.
With interviews, we could get more in-depth feedbacks of players' experiences towards the game.
We could then do some detailed case studies and extract key information out of them.
But either way, we will first design a rough roadmap of the questions we would like to cover for each target to make sure we don't get lost on the topic.

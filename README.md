## Objectives

In this project, we are required to perform a qualitative research.

- By 09/22, we should finish the RQ (research question) proposal and the team contract (I personally prefer to call it an agreement). The submitting link is on [Canvas](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/193792/assignments/2435455).

	- The draft of the team agreement is [already finished](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/blob/master/Team%20Agreement.typ).
	It is written in *Typst*, because I want to try out this new light-weight typesetting language which aims to be a substitution for *LaTeX*.
	For compiled PDF, see the [Releases page](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5130-GW1/releases).

	- The research proposal is being drafted.
	Alex could help design the interviewing process.

- By 09/29, we should be completing the first half of the research thesis (see [description on Canvas](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/193792/assignments/2435456))â€”the Abstract, Related Work and Method sections.

	- By this time, the data collection should have already begun.

	- I will write the thesis with *Typst* as well to practice managing the bibliography; but if that doesn't work, I will switch back to the good ol' *LaTeX*.

- On 10/04, we need to do a presentation to the whole class about our research.

- By 10/13, we should finish and submit the final report thesis.

#heading(numbering: none)[Abstract]

The 2011 video game, _Minecraft_, has successfully started a craze across the globe.
Due to its nature as a sandbox game, _Minecraft_ is able to offer players extensive creative liberties to build their dream world.
However, although it's possible to keep playing in a single world, it's a common phenomenon that many players experience rapid fatigue with the worlds they are currently playing, leading to a cyclical behavior of creating new worlds.
This research aims to find the causes of this phenomenon via qualitative methods.
A preliminary online survey will be conducted to verify the existence of this phenomenon.
The survey will examine players' gaming habits and routines, collected data of which will be analyzed to filter out participants exhibiting the described behavior.
Interviews will then be conducted with consenting players from this subset.
Lastly, the results will be coded and discussed to reveal the crucial causes of the phenomenon.

	- We will be utilizing a survey first in order to gain a baseline idea of how players feel about the concept of starting new worlds, to see how common it is, and what types of players restart their worlds more often than others.

	- We will follow these surveys with in-depth interviews in order to gain a more personal and qualitative idea about how players feel about starting new worlds.
